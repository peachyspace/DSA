Hi there,

My name is Priscila Pintado and join me as I look to refine my data structure and algorithm skills.

Why study data structures and algorithms?

"In JavaScript, developers often spend a lot of time deciding the correct data structure to use. This is because choosing the correct data structure can make it easier to manipulate that data later on, saving time and making code easier to comprehend."
