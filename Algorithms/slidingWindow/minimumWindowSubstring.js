Time: O(t + s) 
â€¢ Iterated through t string
â€¢ Iterated through the s string
	â—¦ i pointer(controlled by for loop) traverses the whole s string ONCE and the start pointer COULD traverse the whole s string ONCE
		â€£ O(2s) time -> O(s) time
	â—¦ we validated the window in O(1) time
		â€£ used variables and looked up values in hash table

Space: O(t + s) 
â€¢ the tCount hash table could potentially have t.length entries if it's characters are all unique  
â€¢ The windowCount hash table could potentially have s.length entries if the window  length === s.length  and every character is UNIQUE.
	â—¦ This means that every character in string s is going to have a hash table mapping
	â—¦  windowCount hash table would have s.length entries 
	â—¦ s="xabcydefgz"    t= "xyz" window's length === s.length, and thus windowCount hash table will have s.length entries

/* 
Main Idea: 
â€¢ we know a substring is valid when the have === need
â€¢ need = Object.keys(tCount).length
â€¢ have will initially be 0 but will be changed when:
	â—¦ add a char to windowCount 
		â€£ char exists in tCount and windowCount[char] === tCount[char]
			â€¢ increment have
	â—¦ remove the char at start from windowCount
		â€£ char exists in tCount and windowCount[char] < tCount[char]
			â€¢ decrement have
â€¢ have will not be changed when windowCount[char] > tCount[char] because windowCount[char] has already fulfilled the requirement(tCount[char]) and is now we are surpassing the requirements ðŸ˜Ž
